# Welcome

The [Swiss Geocomputing Centre](https://wp.unil.ch/geocomputing/) is the [UNIL](https://www.unil.ch/index.html) Centre for Computation and Modelling in Geosciences at the [Faculty of Geosciences and Environment](https://www.unil.ch/gse/fr/home/menuinst/faculte/english/studies-at-fgse.html). It is home of various geo-HPC projects and hosts useful resources about bridging the gap between predictive modelling and data-sciences.

If curious, check out on-going activities:
- the [GPU4GEO](https://github.com/PTsolvers/GPU4GEO) PASC project
- the [STREAM EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/access-our-supercomputers/awarded-projects/spontaneous-rearrangment-ice-motion-stream_en) extreme scale allocation

Have fun checking things out here ðŸš€
