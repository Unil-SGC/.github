# Welcome

The [Swiss Geocomputing Centre](https://wp.unil.ch/geocomputing/) is the [UNIL](https://www.unil.ch/index.html) Centre for Computation and Modelling in Geosciences at the [Faculty of Geosciences and Environment](https://www.unil.ch/gse/fr/home/menuinst/faculte/english/studies-at-fgse.html). It is home of various geo-HPC projects and hosts useful resources about bridging the gap between predictive modelling and data-sciences.

We host monthly geocomputing coffee â˜•  meetings discussing various on-going geocomputational topics and current challengs. You'll find resources at [Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee](https://github.com/Unil-SGC/geocomputing-coffee)

We pioneer Julia HPC projects and GPU computing:
- the [GPU4GEO](https://github.com/PTsolvers/GPU4GEO) PASC project
- the [STREAM EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/access-our-supercomputers/awarded-projects/spontaneous-rearrangment-ice-motion-stream_en) extreme scale allocation
